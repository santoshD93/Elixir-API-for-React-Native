# Kurabu Test - Mobile

This is a fresh React Native installation with no extra dependencies.

## Dependencies

Follow the [React Native setup guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup), **without Expo**.

Depending on your system and the simulator you want to run (we recommend the iOS simulator) there are additional installation steps that take some time. Don't worry there is no time limit on this task.

## Get started

- Install Node.js dependencies with `yarn install` (or `npm install`).
- Start the iOS simulator with `yarn ios` or Android simulator with `yarn android`.

Note: Accessing `localhost` from the iOS simulator should work as is. Accessing your machine's `localhost` on Android is more tricky and requires a proxy setup (e.g. with [https://ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com)), because Android sets up its own `localhost` with the same IP address your machine usually uses.
